# Dataverse Ansible role

This [Ansible][ansible] role installs [Dataverse][dataverse] and its prerequisites.
It installs PostgreSQL 9.3, GlassFish 4.1 and other prerequisites and deploys Dataverse 4.2.1
into GlassFish.

Currently only CentOS 7 is supported and everything will be installed on the same machine.

This is a community effort, only distantly supported by [IQSS][iqss].
